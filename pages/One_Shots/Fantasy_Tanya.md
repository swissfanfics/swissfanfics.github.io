A third life in some medieval fantasy world was probably on the list of the last things I was expecting after I died for a second time. What did I expect to happen? Well, being thrown into some form of Being X’s version of ‘hell’ was probably up there, simply fading away into nothingness was another option. The only thing I expected less than getting another life was probably being put into heaven.

Yet here I was, born again as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed female orphan in another world. Old habits die hard, I suppose. FThough fortunately, this world doesn’t seem so eager to throw itself into a World War, so my future seems to at least be peaceful, if nothing else. However,Though that doesn’t make it easy just yet.

That was made obvious by the fact I was now carrying a bucket full of soapy water to a dirty table in a well-kept tavern. I’ll give this world one thing, its hygiene is far better than what I’ve heard of historical medieval times. Nevertheless, that didn’t change the fact that I was now working as a barmaid, far from the chaos and supposed ‘glory’ of the front lines.

I didn’t quite like this job, especially the outfit that came with it. The outfit was a standard medieval barmaid outfit with a brown skirt that barely fell short of reaching my knees, a tight corset, and an upper cloth portion that clung tightly to my annoyingly large chest.

That last part annoyed me the most as it was something I was stuck with. It was actually just slightly above average more than anything, but compared to my last life it was frustrating to deal with. I suppose not being malnourishutritioned in your vital development years will do that for you.

Another annoying trait is that I’m still below average height. Nowhere near the shortness I was in my past life, but I’m easily around the 5ft line, not much more. I was originally hopeful that I could reach a decent height after figuring out I was reborn as an elf of all things, but it turns out I just got unlucky. Apparently, I was right inwith my assumption that elves are usually taller, but it seems I’m the exception.

Picking up a rag from the soapy water, I bent over the table to start brushing it across it, doing the same cleaning routine I usually did before finishing my shift. I could sense a few people staring behind me as I cleaned. Even without turning around, I could sense their eyes staring holes into me. These impatient bastards can wait until I’m done. There’res plenty of open tables, take those!

Moving on to the next table, I began to clean as I noticed a colorful party of people sitting at the table next to them. Among them was a man clad in full heavy armor, a shorter man in a dark cloak, and a woman holding a tall magical staff with what could only be generously described as ‘suggestive’ clothing.

Despite one assuming that such a group would stick out in a modest tavern like this, they actually were one of the least noticeable groups they got today alone. They were clearly Adventurers, a role which I would’ve designated as a made- up fantasy concept that seems to actually be a genuine profession here.

These adventurers make up the majority of the customers due to this tavern not only doubling as an inn, but also being located so closely to the ‘Guild Hall’ where these adventurers were based out of. Whatever the case, they’re sure paid a whole lot. 

The large tips I get from them are the sole reason I work as a barmaid. However,Though I have noticed that I’ve gotten more tips from male customers thanover female customers. As such I’ve come to assume that males are simply paid more. I suppose the medieval era would still have gender inequality, but it's strange that I haven’t noticed it anywhere else.

One concerning trait I’ve noticed from adventurers is the clothing they choose to wear. Men tend to just try and go for over-the-top outfits with way more details than they really need. Women, on the other hand… Well, they surely loved to show skin, that’s for sure. Almost every single female mage I’ve interacted with has had clothing that showed at least 20% more skin than it probably needed to, and that’s on the generous side.

Whether I liked it or not, that simply seemed to be the fashion of this world, though it meant that my barmaid outfit was somehow usually the least suggestive outfit in the entire tavern.
