An old gray she-cat sat silently looking up at the stars above. The day had been long and the night was cold. Leaf-bare would be upon them soon enough, and with it food would run short and every warrior would be needed to hunt for the clan.

ThunderClan was in a strong position, she had made it that way. It was hard work keeping stability, but it was something she had learned to do well. She had been leader for many moons, after all, and she considered her reign to be at least somewhat successful.

She was far from ThunderClan’s best leader, and there may be others who could’ve done it better, but for now, she would continue to do her job and do it to the best of her ability.

Today was a hard day. What was supposed to be the welcoming of new Kits to the clan, though arguably a strain on the impending Leaf-bare season, was now in jeopardy.

She had set her mind off of the affair, however. She let the Medicine Cat do what she did best. She was a good medicine cat, but she worried that even she wouldn’t be able to salvage the situation.

Turning her head slightly to the side, the gray she-cat looked as the tortoiseshell Medicine Cat approached. Turning her head away, she silently asked, “How is she, Spottedleaf?”

The old she-cat couldn’t see the expression on the medicine cat’s face, but her silence told her more than anything else.

She lowered her head slightly as she heard the Medicine Cat mutter, “I’m sorry, Bluestar. I did all I could.”

Bluestar nodded and turned to look at Spottedleaf, “Of course. I expected nothing less.” She once again turned to look up at the stars, “It is truly unfortunate. Her mate died about a moon ago and now she is gone as well. Her kits will be left without their true mother or father. Tell me, did the kits make it alright, at least?”

Spottedleaf nodded, not that Bluestar could see, “It's too early to say for certain, but I’m optimistic. One of them has shown healthy signs. As for the others… W-Well I’m sure they’ll come around.”

Bluestar shook her head, “You do not need to lie to me, Spottedleaf. At least it seems one of them will survive the night. We're fortunate that Willowpelt had her kit a few days ago, even more so because she only had one.”

“Willowpelt was happy to take in some more kits. I believe she may have been slightly disappointed in only having one anyway. Though I’m afraid she may only have two with this litter.”

“Were the kits named before the mother passed away?” Bluestar asked.

“Just one. Her dying words were naming the golden-furred kit ‘Silverkit’. I’m not sure if she meant to name them that, especially considering their golden fur, but it was her last words so I’m not inclined to go against them. Coincidentally the one she named also seems to be the healthiest at the moment.”

“I see… Either way, make sure Willowpelt is well- fed and taken care of. I’ll inform the clan of the loss. They will be devastated, many were looking forward to having two new litters for the Leaf-bare season.”

“There is one last thing I would like to talk to you about.” Spottedleaf meowed.

Turning around and tilting her head, Bluestar asked, “What is it?”

“Last night I received a prophecy from StarClan. I had hoped to share it with you earlier, but today has been very busy, so I have had to wait.”

Bluestar nodded, “It has been some time since StarClan did something like that. Tell me, what did they say?”

Spottedleaf nodded and began, “An Argent Warrior shall make her stand and through blood and iron will save the clan.”

Bluestar stared off in thought for a few moments before sighing and turning away, “If only StarClan weren’t so cryptic. What is ‘argent’ and what is ‘iron’? The ‘blood’ part doesn’t sound too pleasant for our future either.”

Spottedleaf didn’t seem to have much of an answer herself, “I’m not sure what it means either. All I can deduce is that ‘Blood and Iron’ is probably a saying of some kind. Our main focus should be on what ‘Argent’ means. Do you think it's possible that there’s a reason I got this prophecy now?”

Bluestar turned again, “Do you think it might have something to do with the kits born?”

Spottedleaf, though trying her best to come up with solutions, clearly didn’t seem too confident, “Perhaps, but I don’t have much to go off of. Perhaps they told me today to show what is to come. Maybe their deaths are being used as a sign… I can’t say for certain. There are too many possibilities.”

“Thank you for telling me, Spottedleaf. I’ll think about it and tell you if I come up with any ideas. For now, though, our focus should be on the clan. Leaf-bare is coming, we must be prepared.”

Spottedleaf bowed her head, “Yes Bluestar. I’ll return to watch over the kits for now.”

“Thank you, Spottedleaf.”

“This experiment has outlived its usefulness. I grow tired of your presence. I don’t want you in my domain, I don’t even want you in my hell. I want you gone. You’re lucky as this unfortunately means you get another chance at life. However… No, I know just where to put you. Have fun, Degurechaff, may we never meet again.”

That was the last thing Being X said to me. It’s actually quite funny actually, and I can understand why he didn’t want me in hell either. No matter how much he’d try and torture me, there’s not much he could do to wipe the grin off my face for besting him. I suppose he didn’t want to keep a reflection of his failure, so he sent me here.

The mere fact that worlds exist that aren’t under his ‘domain’ effectively proves that he’s definitely not a god. At least not some ‘creator god’. He’s just some egotistical all-powerful being who doesn’t understand basic economics.

But he does know how to piss me off.

What’s worse than being reincarnated as an orphan in early 20th- Century Germany before the start of the Ffirst World War? Being reincarnated as an orphan and a cat.

A fucking cat.

I can complain all I want about my second life, but at least I was human. A member of a sentient, intelligent, and civilized species. At least most of the time.

Regardless, even I can tell that this isn’t just some normal cat gathering, nor am I born as some housecat. This seems to be an intelligent civilization of cats where the cats can tTalk, organize, and coordinate efforts in intelligent ways.

Despite the apparent ‘civilization’ these cats have developed, it's really only one level up from how I’d expect a normal cluster of cats to act. In short, the civilization these cats have developed could hardly be considered anything above tribal in nature. We’re basically glorified cavemen of cats, and it's been that way for generations it seems.

The group that I’ve been born into is called ‘ThunderClan’ apparently, with three other clans being called ‘ShadowClan’, ‘RiverClan’, and ‘WindClan’. There is also ‘StarClan’ which seems to be more of their interpretation of the afterlife.

While I can’t blame them for developing some tales for what happens after they die, that doesn’t mean I need to believe in the random tribal nonsense that is ‘StarClan’. Most early civilizations had similar stories about the stars being where the dead go to rest or something like that. Some civilizations were more advanced than that, but these cats haven’t even reached tool -usage yet so I can’t blame them.

Actually, without thumbs, I suppose they may never get to tool usage. Sure you could make tools that they could carry in their mouths or attach them to their sides, but how would you make that without human help? I don’t even know if humans exist in this world.

From what I understand of the Clan’s structure, there are only so many roles. At the top of the clan is the Leader, a role which supposedly is given nine lives by StarClan. In essence, it means that if they die they will simply recover not long after as if nothing happened.

I’m obviously skeptical that they actually have nine lives, as in real life the idea of cats having nine only came from their sheer flexibility and strange knack for surviving strange situations. If I had to guess, leaders are just interpreted to have nine lives because they’re naturally among the best in the Clan.

Immediately below the Leader is the Deputy. This is a role that is chosen by the Leader and serves as a ‘Vice-Leader’ in essence. In the event that the leader dies, the Deputy will take on the role of leadership. If the Deputy dies, retires, or is otherwise removed, the leader has to appoint another one pretty much the same day.

Next is the Medicine Cat, something which I didn’t expect to exist yet I am amazed it does. Medicine Cats serve as both healers and religious figures. If ‘StarClan’ has priests, the Medicine Cats would be them.

Fortunately, their healing powers aren’t just ‘say a fancy chant and pray’ but seem to actually be based on medicinal herbs found in the forest. Generation after generation of medicinal knowledge is passed from one cat to another, meaning these cats have a surprisingly good grasp on healing.

The next class is Warriors. These are technically on -par with Medicine Cats, but in reality, due to their religious implications as well as advisory role to the Leader, Warriors are more or less below the Medicine Cat.

Warriors make up the majority of the clan'sClans population and consist of numerous jobs. The main one is hunting prey. I expected mice and other animals inof the forest to taste poorly, but it's surprisingly good, though that’s probably the cat's body talking.

Prey is shared rather than hoarded. Every warrior hunts for the clan first and only eats once they have hunted or done some other job themselves.

As for the other roles Warriors take on, they also take part in patrols around the borders withto the other clans. ThunderClan seems to be in a rather easily defendable position, with a river along our border with RiverClan and the ‘Thunderpath’ on our border with Shadowclan.

I have no idea what a ‘Thunderpath’ is, and while I tried asking, all I was told was that it was a place where fast ‘monsters’ travel. Apparently, they rarely leave the path, so it's safe so long as you don’t go on it without looking.

I think they might just be talking about a road, in which case it means that humans do exist. But that’s a question for later.

The last major job of Warriors is, as the name suggests, to fight. The Clans don’t seem to fight much, and when they do it's often minor skirmishes rather than full-blown wars. Nevertheless, every Warrior is trained how to fight in the event that they need to defend the territory.

I can’t say I’m too happy to be in a society that enlists every single person to become a fighter for the nation, but I can somewhat understand. All the clans do to survive is hunt and defend. There is no agriculture, there are no tools, and there areis basically no other designations you can make. The only way for most in this society to contribute is by learning to fight and hunt.

Of course, there are exceptions. Three, to be specific. The first are ‘Kits’ such as myself. In essence, children that are too young to fight. Of course in six months–or rather, ‘moons’–time they’re deemed old enough anyways. Next are the Queens, basically mothers taking care of Kits. Lastly are Elders, warriors that have served for several years and are now too old to fight or hunt for themselves easily.

It's good to know that I’ll at least have a good few years of retirement, but unfortunately, you do need leader approval to retire. So I’ll have to wait until I am actually old to do so.

Eventually, all kits are made into apprentices. Apprentices are given a ‘mentor’ which is a Warrior among the clan which the leader picks at their discretion. Apparently mentoring an apprentice is a requirement for being made Deputy and by proxy, Leader.

Apprentices are made into warriors at the decision of both their mentor and the approval of the leader. From what I’ve seen, it's mostly the mentors deciding this, but the leader does technically have the power to just not make them a warrior if they don’t want to.

Names also seem to change as you progress through the clan. As a kit, my name is ‘Silverkit’. The prefix stays the same throughout your life, but the suffix changes as you progress. Apprentices for both Medicine Ccats and Warriors receive the suffix ‘paw’. As such, when I inevitably become an apprentice, I will take the name ‘Silverpaw’.

Eventually, apprentices are made into full Warriors or Medicine cats. At this point, their suffix is given by the leader. Sometimes it just seems to be based on their visual appearance, but they can sometimes take a symbolic meaning too. Or sometimes the leader can just spat out some random nonsense that sounds good enough.

Leaders have their own suffix, taking on the title of ‘star’ when they take on the role. All of these naming schemes seemingly being consistent across the clans.

In fact, from what I can tell, the only difference in the clans is the environment they hunt in, with the names being simply explanations of just what those are. Except for ThunderClan which really makes no sense. I guess we’re fast? Maybe? We’re more of the forest clan. WindClan seems to be the fast ones with open hills. Shadowclan seems to have a marshier forest. Riverclan just seems to like rivers.

All the clans also seem to follow the ‘Warrior Code’ which seems to be a glorified set of international laws between clans. It's basically the Geneva Convention of cats. Though the code was technically made and expanded by the clans from what I’ve been told, it seems to have some vaguely religious backing with a connection to StarClan.

Whatever the case is with all the clans, it appears I’m stuck here. This is simply the life I’ve been given and I’ll be damned if I just give it up. The question I have remaining is just what path do I take?

Medicine Cats seem to be the safest job, they don’t fight and the only major restriction seems to be that they aren’t allowed to have kits. I wasn’t planning to have cat sex anyways, so that works out quite well. The problem with that is frankly that I don’t really want to be some strange cat-priest. While I could certainly pretend, I don’t think I could keep up the act for long enough without slipping up and potentially endangering my position within the clan.

As such, I may unfortunately be stuck with the life of a warrior.
