"You mean you can summon even MORE Otherworlders, Razen?" The large and aging king looked shocked as he asked this question to the head mage, a man of seemingly equal age, though who had changed bodies numerous times already.

The mage wore an elaborate robe and carried around a magical staff as a conduit for his power. As the King asked this, he nodded, "We believed the connection we had with this new world would collapse shortly after we commenced that initial summoning, but our magical probing has shown the opposite. The barrier between that world and this one is destabilizing, and we may be able to take advantage of it to summon even more otherworlders."

One of the high-ranking nobles seemed skeptical, asking, "Wasn't it just a few months ago that you told us another ritual would be impossible from that world?!"

Razen nodded without a second of pause, "That's what we thought, and by all accounts that should've been the case. If I had to guess, there's some unseen factor we're not accounting for here. I believe we should keep a close eye on whatever this factor may be while we commence new summoning rituals."

One of the nobles addressed the King in worry, "My Lord, I fear our mages won't be able to keep up with these constant otherworlder summonings. Sure, they might bring us great power, but I fear we may not be able to sustain such long endeavors. That's not to mention what the first ritual brought us! A mage we can't control! Do you know how many mages she could've killed had we not stopped her on FIVE different occasions? We cannot risk our mages like this under a promise of potentially getting more; it's too much of a gamble!"

"I respect your opinion," the King began, "but this is too vital an opportunity to waste. We don't know when another opening like this will occur. Razen, you have my full permission to recruit as many otherworlders as you believe we can. Taking in the concerns of this country's nobility, do try to give the mages some time to breathe between summonings. I think a few days to a week will be enough."

"It will be plenty, my Lord. Thank you." Razen replied with a polite nod toward the King.

"You will have all the resources you may need, spare no expense for this project, it needs to succeed!" the King proclaimed with a wave of his hand.

With that, the meeting ended and the various members of it dispersed throughout the castle. Razen knew he had a lot of work ahead of him. Organizing an otherworlder summoning was as much a magical difficulty as it was a political one, convincing so many nobles to hand over their mages for so long wouldn't be an easy task, and in the end, he may have to take a more direct role in the ritual itself, but for what they and he could gain from it, it was worth it.

"Well in order to become a Demon Lord, one needs the recognition of the Ten Great Demon Lords! The main way to do this is through getting recognition at Walpurgis. Luckily for you, I asked some of the Demon Lords and they agreed to vote to host one!" Milim stood proudly across from Tanya who sat at her desk in the Military HQ. Rimuru sat on a nearby couch alongside Benimaru and Hakurou with Vesta, Otto, and Kurt on a couch at the opposite side of the room. Eiga, meanwhile, stood professionally behind Tanya with her hands behind her back.

"How does one even call a Walpurgis anyways? You mentioned them being a lot more casual than the 'prelude to great wars' that the human nations seem to document it as." Tanya mentioned as she looked towards Milim for answers.

Milim smiled, raising one finger as she said, "It's simple! You need the support of three Demon Lords in order for a Walpurgis to be called. Of course, Demon Lords aren't required to attend. Many Walpurgis are glorified tea parties anyways, so some tend to not show up. But for an event like declaring a new Demon Lord, it's likely most will attend, if nothing else just to see if you're let in."

"And which Demon Lords did you get to support you with this Walpurgis?" Tanya asked. It was good to know who these were, if they were allies of Milim they could be made into allies of herself, after all.

"The first one is my friend Ramiris and the second one is Carrion. Ramiris is my friend and so just went along with it, meanwhile Carrion was interested in a new Demon Lord appearing on his northern border."

*'So the Beast Kingdom's taken an interest in us? It was probably inevitable. If Dwargon could hear about such a large gathering of majin in the forest, surely the Demon Lord Carrion would too. Best to stay on his good side, from what lycanthropes that come from the region say, the Kingdom's main focus is on strength after all.'*

"And when is the Walpurgis planned to occur?" Tanya asked.

"Oh, tonight!" Milim said with a smile.

"Tonight?!" Tanya shouted in shock, practically slamming the table.

"Yeah… Is that a problem?"

Tanya grumbled but quickly collected herself and sat back down.

Milim continued, "Oh yeah, you're allowed to bring two subordinates. Only two though, someone once tried to bring a whole army and someone got pissed off and killed them all. From then on it's been only two."

"I see…" Tanya tapped on the desk and looked around the room at the candidates, "I'll be bringing Eiga and Benimaru. That is if neither of you mind."

Eiga made a proud salute and smiled, her bladed tail swaying rapidly behind her, "I'll gladly attend with you, Ma'am!"

Tanya turned to Benimaru as he nodded, "I'll follow you to the depths of hell, Chancellor."

"Huh? I could go…" Rimuru muttered, feeling somewhat left out of the major event.

"Rimuru, I'm not risking this nation losing BOTH of its leaders in a single night," Tanya muttered.

"Good point…" Rimuru responded with a dejected look on his face.

With her companions decided, Tanya began, "Hakurou will be placed in de-facto command of the military in my absence. Keep the military on high alert, we don't know if one of the Demon Lords may use this as an opportunity to strike. Even if it's unlikely, we must be prepared."

Vesta rubbed his chin before asking, "Wouldn't this be a good time to test out the Tempestian Barrier Defense System?"

"Wasn't that project still in testing?" Otto asked.

"Yes, but we believe it to be functional now. Although still technically an early prototype, it's better to have something than nothing. Worst case scenario it just doesn't work. Either way, it would be good to test how long we can maintain it without issues." Vesta responded with Otto nodding along.

"Tempestian Barrier what-now?" Rimuru asked, confused by all this technical mumbo-jumbo they seemed to be spitting out.

Tanya shook her head and explained, "Think of my barrier but applied to the entire city. If an attack were to be launched at Tempestia, like let's say a giant beam of magic or an aerial bombardment, the barrier would protect Tempestia from taking the hit. It doesn't guard any attacks that occur inside Tempestia, but attacks made from outside can be guarded against to a degree."

"Ah, so it really is just a giant shield around Tempestia… Just how far are you guys along in your research? Next thing you know you're going to be making a nuclear reactor."

"That's a project for later. Right now our focus is on defense. Vesta, you're free to use the barrier as you please." Tanya nodded towards Vesta who made his own nod in response.

"Would you agree that now would be a good time to deploy the Panzer corps?" Otto asked Tanya who thought for a moment.

"I know they have better magicule cores but still… Eh, I suppose there's no harm in it. You can mobilize the First Tank Company. Try not to use more power than you can refill, the tanks should be in full fighting condition in the event of an attack."

"Understood, Kanzlerin," Otto replied.

Tanya turned to Eiga whose posture stiffened in response, "Send out the Blade Lions and the Direwolves that evolved into Demon Wolves after I named them. Have them be on constant patrol and leave the Goblin Riders and other military units on reserve in Tempestia itself."

Eiga made a firm salute in response, "Yes Ma'am!"

Tanya now turned to Kurt, "Kurt, make sure the 203rd is at the ready in Fort Veldora. If anything comes up, especially aerially, Gabiru and the battalion will go and deal with it along with any other appropriate forces. Also, have all the lizardmen mobilized in Eidechia just in case."

"Understood!" Kurt proclaimed.

"I think that should be it." Tanya muttered to herself, now looking up at Rimuru, "I'll leave the rest to you, you're ultimately the second strongest one here. If something big happens, it may be down to you."

"Of course, I understand. Though I can't help but think all this preparation might be a bit excessive…" Rimuru muttered.

"Yeah, I think you're overreacting." Milim muttered after standing in the center of the room, bored as Tanya rambled on about 'military preparations' and 'defenses'.

"That's easy for you to say," Tanya grumbled.

The sun had long since set over the horizon, the light of the full moon shining down onto the city below. While many slept calmly that night, just as many did not, would not, or could not. It seemed like every corner of the city held an armed guard, every street another formation of men, and throughout the entire city. One would be forgiven for assuming Tempest would be going to war.

Tanya gazed out of the window of the General Staff Headquarters onto the street below. Looking down, she saw the pale blue light of the moon reflect off of the green armor of the new tanks as they rolled down the street. As they neared the street's end, they split off, forming into different groups as they formed defensive parameters around the city.

*'Just what have I gotten myself into…?'* Tanya mused with a long sigh. She knew, or rather had hoped, that becoming a Demon Lord would safeguard her future, the nation's future and the world's future. If Tempest could be protected, then there wouldn't be anything stopping her.

She would tear this world from its roots and build a new one out of the old one's burning ashes. It wouldn't be easy, and it wouldn't be painless. In her first world, it was a slow and painful process. Hundreds, thousands, millions even, died over centuries in revolutions, wars, factories, in all sorts of ways, all in a means to an end.

Creating a modern world with peace wasn't possible, or rather, it wasn't practical. Corrupt kings will fall, nobility will collapse, and countless will die in bloody struggles over power and modernization.

There was a reason that the rifle was called the 'great equalizer'.

Rimuru didn't realize it yet, and Tanya didn't intend to tell him, but so many more would die in such a short time for her world to be realized. Modernization would come, the monarchies of the world, with some strange exceptions due to the nature of this world, would collapse, and democracies would take their place.

Rimuru seemed to believe this as well, but Tanya knew it hadn't yet processed for him what the true price of it all would be. But despite all of that, all of the impending blood, conflict, death, and destruction, Tanya believed that Tempest had to survive it all.

Tempest was the conduit, the tool to bring about the world she wanted, and if it fell, she'd have to start over, or who knows if she could start at all. Tempest was the gateway to a modern world, and if being a Demon Lord had even a chance of helping prevent its destruction, it's what she needed to do.

This world was hers to correct, hers to fix. It was a greedy plan, one far from her supposed modest ambition of an executive role in the rear echelon of the army she had once desired in the empire. This was a far greedier ambition. If she had to live in such a cursed, backward, medieval world, she'd be damned if she didn't fix it.

'This has to be done. A revolution needs bodies to fuel its furnace and blood to oil its gears, and I will make certain that it does not come from Tempest.'

Tanya turned her gaze away from the window, turning around as she saw a glowing purple line appear on the floor. Emerging from it was an elaborately-designed door, designed way too dramatically for Tanya's liking. After it fully emerged the doors swung open to reveal a dark misty void of blues and purples.

Stepping out of the void was what on the surface appeared to be a simple maid with long green hair and deep green eyes. Almost immediately Tanya could tell who she was 'If her hair is anything to go by, she's the Green Primordial, Vert. Noir didn't tell me much about the other Primordials, but it's not entirely surprising to see one serving the one that seems to be the strongest. There's also a chance this isn't a primordial but just a high-ranking green demon, but I doubt it.'

Milim pretty much bounced forwards toward the demon with a wave, "Hey Misery!"

*'Misery?! The Primordial is **NAMED?** What kind of name is Misery? Actually… Considering the fact we're demons, I suppose I can see where it comes from. I may be the outlier with a name like 'Tanya'.'*

The maid bowed towards Milim, "I have come to pick you up, Lady Milim." As she raised her head she turned to look at Tanya. For a brief moment, Tanya could see confusion and shock in her eyes, though she quickly suppressed it, "I assume you are Lady Tanya?"

"That is correct," Tanya responded, trying to get any sort of read on the demon, but with her power surpassing Tanya's, she wasn't able to see much with her skills.

*'I hope this isn't a consistent trend among the Demon Lords… If all of them are strong enough to entirely resist my [Transcending Eye], I would be at a disadvantage.'*

"I have come to collect you and Lady Milim." Misery said with a polite bow once more.

As Milim began to walk through the portal, Tanya, Benimaru, and Eiga followed, with Misery shortly behind them as the gate closed and descended back into the floor.

As Tanya walked through the purple mist, she found herself in another room, seemingly far from Tempest, though where exactly she wasn't sure. The room had a large circular table with numerous seats positioned around it. A glowing magic emanated from the center of the table, reaching up into the sky above, which, despite being a fake, was still littered with stars like the true night sky.

The walls of the room stretched far above her head, made with elaborate designs clearly meant to be dramatic. For a group of people called 'Demon Lords' Tanya certainly thought it was fitting.

The only one currently sitting appeared to be a red-haired man, however even a slight inspection could tell the sheer power he had. The man was a threat beyond no other.

'No doubt in my mind that's Guy, the Primordial Red. I'm not even certain Veldora would beat him. Just how powerful is he?'

With his power being so far beyond Tanya's, she had no way of even getting a glance of his skills or power, only able to gauge him from his aura alone, one which now overflowed into the area around them. A human in his presence would probably die instantly from the pressure.

Tanya was guided to a seat by the maid as Milim sat down as well, giving a quick and happy wave toward Guy. After a few seconds, another Demon Lord came through one of the many portals along the walls of the room, a muscular man with golden eyes and a presence fitting of a King. Tanya knew who he was instantly, the Beast Master of Eurzania, Tempest's southern neighbor.

Unlike Guy, his presence was much less intimidating, relatively speaking, and showed a clear power difference among the Demon Lords. His power was weak enough for Tanya to get a good look at his race, confirming her suspicions of him being Demon Lord Carrion.

Following behind Carrion were two of his subordinates who took their place standing by the door. Both were lycanthropes of exceptional strength, though not strong enough to evade Tanya's [Transcending eye]. The first of the two was a white-haired tiger lycanthrope, though unlike Eiga she seemed to be an actual tiger rather than an evolution of a blade tiger.

The second one was a woman with black and yellow hair wearing a revealing white kimono which Tanya noted as looking more like a bathrobe. Further analysis showed her to be a snakeman lycanthrope and the stronger one of Carrion's two subordinates.

Who followed next was a well-endowed woman wearing a suggestive red dress with a pair of large white wings and bird-like feet. Despite her animalistic appearance, she could still be considered a remarkable beauty, though Tanya considered her nothing but another Demon Lord.

Similar to Carrion, she could identify her instantly, 'Demon Lord Frey, Sky Queen of the Harpy Kingdom of Fulbrosia. They're also our southern neighbor with her domain being next to Carrion's. Best to not aggravate Fulbrosia or Eurzania if I can.'

After Frey came a man in a well-kept white suit with a black bowtie. Out of all the Demon Lords currently present, he seemed to be the most formally dressed. He came in carrying a glowing multi-tailed fox in his arms, calmly petting it as he sat down.

*'He's the weakest so far, but with those skills, I can see how one could make up for it.'*

His skills, **[Demon Marionette]** and **[Marionette Dance]** seemed to grant him control over majin, likely even those a bit stronger than him. Fortunately, with Mental Influence Nullification she was safe from magic like that, but still she knew to remain cautious.

Nevertheless, she knew who he was as well, Demon Lord Clayman of Jistav. He, Frey and Carrion were amongst the most active Demon Lords, meaning Tanya's documentation from human nations spoke of them often enough.

Next came what appeared to be a small fairy. Tanya hid how startled she was to see what seemed on the surface to be a glorified pushover be considered a Demon Lord, but a glance at her skills seemed to show some potential. Her [Small World] skill, while Tanya couldn't fully tell the properties of, seemed to be powerful in the right, albeit very specific, circumstances.

What was behind her was significantly more intimidating. As the fairy flew in, a giant beast of magisteel stomped in behind her.
